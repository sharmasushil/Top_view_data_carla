CARLA is an open-source autonomous driving simulator. Custom maps, cars, sensors, and many more features are included. I'll show you how to spawn a vehicle in the desired area in CARLA in this tutorial. The Python API can be used to interface with CARLA.

Let's get started right now.

First and foremost, you must locate the location where your Carla is installed.

##### Run the command in terminal

./CarlaUE4.sh /Game/Maps/RaceTrack -windowed -carla-server -quality-level=Low -Resx=640 -ResY=480 \
